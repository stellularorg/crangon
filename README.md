# 🦐 Crangon

* `crates/pastemd` - backend (forked from [pastemd](https://docs.rs/pastemd))
* `crates/crangon` - frontend (forked from [sealable](https://github.com/hkauso/sealable))

Both forks only exist to keep using Guppy, as both pastemd and sealable switched to using the newer [starstraw](https://github.com/hkauso/starstraw).
